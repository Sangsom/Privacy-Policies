# Privacy Policy

**DuePilot — Last updated: 10 February 2026**

---

## 1. Introduction

DuePilot helps you track recurring payments (subscriptions, bills, loans, and more). This policy describes what data we use, where it is stored, and how we work with third-party services.

By using DuePilot, you accept this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.

---

## 2. Data stored on your device

Your recurring items (titles, amounts, dates, categories, notes), reminder settings, loan terms, preferences (such as default currency), and similar app data are stored **only on your device** in local storage. We do not upload this data to our servers.

If you use the export feature (e.g. CSV), the export is created on your device and remains there until you choose to share or move it elsewhere.

---

## 3. No bank or financial-account linking

We do not connect to banks or financial institutions. All payment data you see in the app is entered by you or derived from that data.

---

## 4. Third-party services

We use two types of third-party services:

- **Subscriptions (RevenueCat)**  
  We use RevenueCat to manage Pro subscription status. RevenueCat receives purchase and entitlement information from Apple so we can unlock Pro features. We do not send your recurring items or payment details to RevenueCat. For how RevenueCat handles data, see [RevenueCat’s privacy policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

- **Analytics (Firebase)**  
  We use Firebase (Google) for usage analytics (e.g. which screens are used) to improve the app. We do not send your recurring items, amounts, or other financial data to Firebase. Analytics may use identifiers (e.g. device or app instance) as described in [Firebase’s](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy) and [Google’s](https://policies.google.com/privacy) privacy policies.

---

## 5. How we use data

- **On-device data:** Used only to provide the app (calendar, reminders, dashboards, loan insights).
- **Third-party data:** Subscription status is used to unlock Pro features; analytics are used to understand usage and improve the product.
- We do **not** sell your personal data.

---

## 6. Data retention

- Data on your device remains until you delete it or uninstall the app.
- For third-party services (RevenueCat, Firebase), data retention is governed by their respective policies.

---

## 7. Your choices

- You can delete or edit your data at any time within the app. Uninstalling the app removes local data.
- You can limit ad tracking in iOS Settings (Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking). Our app does not send your financial data to analytics.

---

## 8. Children

DuePilot is not directed at children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## 9. Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the new version and update the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
