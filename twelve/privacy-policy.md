# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** February 18, 2026

Twelve ("we", "our", or "the app") is a goal execution and accountability app for iOS. We built Twelve with a simple principle: your goals are your business. This policy explains what data we collect, why, and how it is handled.

## Data stored on your device

All of your personal content — goals, tactics, weekly scores, vision statements, and cycle history — is stored locally on your device using Apple's Core Data framework. We do not have access to this data. It never leaves your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third party.

If you delete the app or use the "Delete All Data" option in Settings, this data is permanently removed.

## Analytics

We use Google Firebase Analytics to collect anonymized usage data. This helps us understand how the app is used so we can improve it. Firebase Analytics collects information such as which screens are viewed, which features are used, and general engagement patterns. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.

Firebase Analytics may collect device-level identifiers and general device information (such as device model and operating system version) in accordance with [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

You can limit ad tracking and analytics collection through your device's privacy settings under **Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking**.

## Subscriptions

Twelve offers an optional premium subscription managed through RevenueCat. If you choose to subscribe, your purchase is processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information.

RevenueCat receives a pseudonymous app user ID and transaction data from Apple to manage your subscription status. RevenueCat does not receive your name, email address, or Apple ID. You can review [RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/) for full details on how they handle subscription data.

## Notifications

Twelve uses local notifications (scheduled entirely on your device) to send weekly reminders and check-ins. These notifications are never sent through a remote server. You can enable or disable each notification type in the app's Settings, or manage notification permissions in iOS Settings.

## Data we do NOT collect

To be explicit, Twelve does **not** collect:

- Your name, email address, or any contact information
- Location data
- Photos, files, or any content from your device
- Health or fitness data
- Browsing history
- Contacts, calendars, or other app data
- Any data from other apps on your device

## Third-party services

Twelve integrates with the following third-party services:

| Service | Purpose | Privacy policy |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Firebase Analytics | Anonymized usage analytics | [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |
| RevenueCat | Subscription management | [RevenueCat Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/) |

We do not use any advertising SDKs, social media trackers, or data brokers.

## Children's privacy

Twelve is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

## Data retention

Since your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it at all times. We retain anonymized analytics data in Firebase for up to 14 months, after which it is automatically deleted per Google's data retention policies.

## Changes to this policy

If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the effective date at the top of this page. For material changes, we will provide notice through an in-app update or on our website.
