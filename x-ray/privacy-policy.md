# Privacy Policy — Portfolio tracker: X-Ray

**Effective date:** 2026-01-29

Portfolio tracker: X-Ray (“**X-Ray**”, “**we**”, “**us**”) is a portfolio clarity app. It lets you manually track assets and liabilities on your device and optionally uses anonymous analytics to improve the product.

---

## 1) What data we collect

### A) Data you enter (stored locally)
X-Ray stores the information you type into the app on your device (for example: assets, liabilities, valuations, notes, tags, reminders).  
**We do not require an account**, and we do **not** ask for your name, email, or phone number to use the app.

### B) Analytics (optional, anonymous)
If you allow analytics, X-Ray collects **anonymous usage data** through **Firebase Analytics (Google)**, such as:
- Screen views and navigation patterns
- Feature usage events (e.g., onboarding completion, asset added, insights viewed)
- App and device information (device model, OS version, app version/build)
- Event timestamps

**We do not send your portfolio values or portfolio contents to Firebase.**  
**We do not collect your precise location.**

You can opt out any time (see Section 6).

### C) Subscriptions (RevenueCat)
If you purchase Premium, subscriptions are processed via Apple’s in-app purchase system and managed by **RevenueCat** to validate entitlements.  
We do not receive your full payment details (Apple handles that). RevenueCat may process purchase and entitlement information.

### D) Notifications (Reminders)
If you enable reminders, X-Ray uses Apple notification services to schedule local notifications.  
Notification permission is optional, and you can change it in iOS Settings.

## 2) What we do **not** collect
We do **not** collect:
- Your name, email address, phone number
- Your contacts
- Your exact location
- Your portfolio holdings and values for analytics purposes
- Your payment card information

---

## 3) Why we collect data

### Analytics is used only for:
- Improving onboarding and reducing drop-offs
- Understanding feature usage to prioritize improvements
- Measuring conversion funnel events (e.g., paywall shown, purchase completed)
- Diagnosing bugs and app flow issues

### Analytics is **not** used for:
- Advertising
- Ad targeting
- Selling data
- Cross-app tracking

---

## 4) How we share data
- **Firebase Analytics (Google):** If analytics is enabled, anonymous usage events and device/app information are processed by Google as a service provider.
- **RevenueCat:** Subscription entitlement validation and purchase lifecycle events are handled by RevenueCat.

We do not share your personal identity (because we don’t collect it).

---

## 5) Data retention
- Portfolio data you enter remains on your device until you delete it (e.g., “Clear All Data”).
- Firebase Analytics data retention follows Google/Firebase settings and policies (commonly up to 14 months for standard reports, depending on configuration).

---

## 6) Your choices & controls

### Opt out of analytics
You can disable analytics at any time:
1. Open **Settings** in X-Ray  
2. Find **Privacy**  
3. Turn off **“Share anonymous usage analytics”**

When analytics is off:
- No new analytics events are sent
- No analytics user properties are updated
- Existing Firebase data (already collected) remains subject to Firebase retention policies

### Manage subscription
Subscriptions are managed in iOS:
- iOS Settings → your Apple ID → Subscriptions

### Notifications
You can enable/disable notifications in:
- iOS Settings → Notifications → X-Ray

---

## 7) Data security
We take reasonable measures to protect data. X-Ray is designed to store portfolio data locally on your device.  
No method of storage or transmission is 100% secure, but we aim to keep things simple and safe.

---

## 8) Children’s privacy
X-Ray is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## 9) Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy. If we do, we’ll update the “Effective date” above. Significant changes may also be communicated inside the app.
